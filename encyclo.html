					<p>Kids love to look at animals and this book showcases more than 1,000 gorgeous color photographs as only National Geographic—the leader in wildlife photography—can. Thematic spreads take readers through animal homes and habitats, senses and communication, life cycle and babies, movement and migration, defenses, camouflage, and adaptation, and endangered animals and conservation. Special features in each section include Animal Profiles spreads that focus in-depth on a particular animal and Animal Records spreads that highlight superlatives such as fastest, tallest, smallest, etc. Exclusive From-the-Field reports that focus on National Geographic explorers and their stories about the animals they study can only be found in this animal encyclopedia.</p>

					<p>Animals are organized by taxonomy within each section (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates), accompanied by common and scientific name, fact boxes (featuring lifespan, habitat, and size) and text describing diet, special features, and any other pertinent information. Symbols representing conservation and habitat status highlight a high-interest topic for kids, while color-coding on each section provides for ease of navigation. Includes a listing of animal species along with basic information including name (scientific and common), lifespan, diet, size, and habitat. A comprehensive glossary, index, and "find out more" section round out this must-have resource.</p></details>
